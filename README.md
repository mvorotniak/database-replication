## Master-Slave database replication
1. Replication Setup
```
Master: mysql-m
Slave 1: mysql-s1
Slave 2: mysql-s2
```
The master-slave replication worked as expected. Data inserted into the master (mysql-m) was automatically replicated to both slaves (mysql-s1 and mysql-s2).

2. Script to Write Data Frequently

The script simulated continuous write operations on the master, and the replication successfully propagated the changes to the slaves.

3. Stopping Slave (mysql-s1)

Replication for mysql-s1 stopped, but mysql-s2 continued to receive updates from the master.
The master remained unaffected, and the second slave (mysql-s2) still received data.
After restarting mysql-s1, replication resumed from where it left off. The replication process ensured that no data was lost while the slave was down.

4. Changes on Slave Node (mysql-s1)

a. Removing the Last Column: Replication continues

b. Removing a Column from the Middle: Replication continues, but with incorrect data (with data of column `name` instead of `name2`). This happens because the MySQL replication system does not track column namesâ€”it assumes that the schema on the master and slave are identical and relies on column positions instead.

When you remove a column from a slave node's table (without modifying the master), replication can still continue, but it can lead to unexpected behavior, like incorrect data being inserted into the remaining columns.
